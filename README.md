# HTTP Multiplexer

A fork of `sish`, and an open-source of `serveo`. Allows for authenticated HTTP request multiplexing via SSH tunneling for subdomains and general domains.

## Additional Functionality

Allows multiplexing for general domains, in addition to subdomains. Multiplexed tunnels for domains are assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis. Multiplexed tunnels for subdomains must be fully-qualified, unlike the usage of `sish` or `serveo`.
